# Sample Audit Report Conducted by SecureContract

### INTRODUCTION
The X Protocol is a DeFi network built on Solana that will include the stablecoin XAI, a non-custodial lending market, and a margin trading vAMM. These are all use cases designed to solve one single problem: making value locked in DeFi systems accessible.
X engaged SecureContract to conduct a security assessment on their Smart contracts beginning on September 10, 2021. The security assessment was scoped to the smart contract provided in a Github repository and an audit of the security risk and implications regarding the changes introduced by the development team at X prior to its production release shortly following the assessments deadline.

### AUDIT SUMMARY
The team at SecureContract was provided several weeks for the engagement and assigned two full time security engineers to audit the security of the smart contract. The security engineers are blockchain and smart-contract security experts with advanced penetration testing, smart-contract hacking, and deep knowledge of multiple blockchain protocols.

The purpose of this audit to achieve the following:

- Ensure that smart contract functions are intended.
- Identify potential security issues with the smart contracts.

Though this security auditâ€™s outcome is satisfactory, only the most essential aspects were tested and verified to achieve objectives and deliverables set in the scope due to time and resource constraints. 
It is essential to note the use of the best practices for secure smart contract development.
